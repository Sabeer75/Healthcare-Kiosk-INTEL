# 🏥 QR-Based Secure Hospital Check-In System

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project replaces expensive and privacy-risky face recognition systems with a **secure, QR-based mobile check-in solution** for hospitals. Patients use a mobile app to scan AES-encrypted QR codes at kiosks for **fast, contactless registration**—no biometrics, no delays.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

Can we provide a secure, scalable, and cost-effective check-in solution for hospitals **without relying on facial recognition or biometrics**?

> Current issues with hospital check-in systems:
- ❌ Manual processes are slow and error-prone
- ❌ Face recognition requires expensive hardware
- ❌ Privacy concerns due to biometric storage
- ❌ Vulnerable to deepfakes and spoofing

---

## ✅ Our Proposal

A **QR-code-based mobile authentication system**:
- 🔒 Uses AES-256 encryption
- 📱 Scans from any Android/iOS mobile app
- 🚫 No facial or biometric data needed
- ⚙️ Easily integrates with existing hospital systems

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

### 🌐 Web Kiosk Interface
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)

### 📲 Mobile App
- **App Platform**: MIT App Inventor
- **QR Scanning + Decryption**: Implemented using AES algorithm in the app
- **Communication**: Secure HTTP requests to kiosk (Flask backend)
